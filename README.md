# PokéWiki

## Description

This site is a Pokémon search engine designed to look like a game. Search for any Pokémon in the Pokédex and you will be presented with the presented with the Pokémon's name, sprite, number, and types. Additionally, you can see a short description and a link to a Wikipedia page if you would like to learn more. There is also a feature to save your favorite Pokémon searches to come back to.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
